## Known Issues

-  The use of Bootstrap in this portfolio may cause link connectivity issues. If you are experiencing display issues
   or broken links, it is possible that the wrong version of Bootstrap was used or that the links were incorrectly
   linked. To help you troubleshoot this issue, I have provided the correct links to the necessary Bootstrap files
   below:
   -  CSS:
      -  [bootstrap.min.css](https://github.com/athena3140/portfolio/blob/main/cdn-css/bootstrap.min.css)
   -  JavaScript:
      -  [bootstrap.bundle.min.js](https://github.com/athena3140/portfolio/blob/main/cdn-js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js)
      -  [bootstrap.min.js](https://github.com/athena3140/portfolio/blob/main/cdn-js/bootstrap.min.js)
      -  [jquery-3.6.3.min.js](https://github.com/athena3140/portfolio/blob/main/cdn-js/jquery-3.6.3.min.js)
      -  [popper.min.js](https://github.com/athena3140/portfolio/blob/main/cdn-js/popper.min.js)

To ensure that you have the latest version of the files, please download them directly from my project repository and
link them correctly in your project. If you continue to experience issues, please do not hesitate to contact me for
further assistance.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as I work to resolve this issue. I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio
